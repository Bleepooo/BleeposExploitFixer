/Help command
/Say command
/Kill Command

All of these options are configurable!

How to reload the config:

Do /befreload. This will prevent you from having to stop the server to save changes to the config.

(I recently changed the native build version to 1.12.2 since most anarchy servers are on 1.12.2. If you would like a build of it for newer versions, please join the discord. Before you ask for a newer version, please test this build on your server.)
